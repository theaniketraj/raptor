            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Raptor is an AI-powered smart helmet designed to enhance rider safety through real-time accident
                detection and emergency alert systems. The helmet integrates IoT sensors, AI-based crash detection, and
                automated emergency response mechanisms to ensure immediate assistance in case of an accident.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the rising number of road accidents involving two-wheelers, many riders fail to receive timely
                medical attention, leading to severe consequences. Raptor aims to solve this by automatically detecting
                crashes and alerting emergency contacts with real-time location details.
            </p>

        <section id="project-motivation">
            <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
            <p>Road safety is a critical issue worldwide, especially for motorcyclists. While conventional helmets
                provide physical protection, they lack smart features to assist riders in emergencies. Raptor goes
                beyond traditional helmet designs by integrating AI-driven crash detection and real-time communication
                to save lives.
                <br>
                <br>
                Key Features & Implementation
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                1. AI-Based Crash Detection System
                    Accelerometer & Gyroscope Sensors detect sudden impact, abrupt <br>motion changes, and helmet tilt angles,
                    determining if a crash has occurred.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → AI algorithms analyze sensor data to distinguish between a normal fall and a severe accident.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → The system prevents false alarms by using Impact Threshold models trained on real-world riding data.
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul>
                2. Emergency Alert & Live Location Sharing
                Upon detecting an accident, Raptor automatically sends an SOS alert to emergency contacts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → The alert includes the rider’s live GPS location, allowing responders to reach the accident site
                    quickly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → Uses ESP-32 module for real-time location tracking, even in low-connectivity areas.
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                3. Fall & Unconsciousness Detection
                If a rider falls but doesn’t move for a certain period, the system assumes unconsciousness and triggers
                emergency alerts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → Integrated pulse sensor & body temperature monitor can detect abnormal rider conditions.
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                4. Smart Helmet Lock System (Prevention Feature)
                The helmet has an ignition-locking mechanism, ensuring the bike won’t start unless the helmet is worn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → Uses RFID/NFC authentication for secure user verification before ignition.
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                5. Mobile App Integration for Alerts & Tracking
                The helmet connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth, allowing riders to:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → View ride analytics & helmet status.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → Receive battery & sensor health alerts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → Customize emergency contact details.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → The app is designed with a clean, user-friendly UI, ensuring easy navigation and real-time monitoring.
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                6. Voice Assistance & Hands-Free Communication
                Built-in Bluetooth speakers & microphone allow for hands-free calls and navigation assistance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    → AI voice commands enable riders to control features without distraction.</p>
